Welcome to the **C&S Upper House Wiki!** Here you can find everything about the struggles previous members of the Upper House went through during their thesis. We made this wiki because we want to help you, prospective yet relatively virgin student, avoid the gruelling dangers present in the jungle that is your master's thesis. So, learn from the lessons taught on this website, and obtain your *license to control and simulate* in record (a.k.a. nominal) time!
