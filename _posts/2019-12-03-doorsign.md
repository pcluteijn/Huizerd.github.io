Simple template to create the Upper House (panda bear) door sign, made with [InkScape](https://inkscape.org) and [Microsoft Office](https://www.surfspot.nl/software/microsoft-office.html).

### Instructions

Open the file and edit the text in the "_text_" layer, use the build in export function to create a [png-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics). 

Open the docx-file in Microsoft Office Word. Here the old [png-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) is displayed and needs to be changed to the new [png-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics), which you have just created with InkScape. 

Right click the image, click "_change image_" and select the new [png-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics). Print the document to your nearest printer and trim it with a scissor. **Note that the Word document is made such that the printout has the proper dimensions to fit the door sign frame!**
