Simple template to create the UpperHouse (Pandabear) door sign, made with [InkScape](https://inkscape.org) and [Microsoft Office](https://www.surfspot.nl/software/microsoft-office.html) .

### Instructions

Open the file and edit the text in the "text" layer, use the build in export function to create a [png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) file. 

Open the docx-file in Microsoft Office Word. Here the old png-file is displayed and needs to be changed to the new png-file, which you have just created with InkScape. Right click the image, click "change image" and select the new png-file. Print the document to your nearest printer and trim it with a scissor. Note that the office document is made such that the printout has the proper dimensions!
